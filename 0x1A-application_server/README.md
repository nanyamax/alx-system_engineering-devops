In a typical deployment, a website that provides both static and dynamically generated content runs web servers for the static content and application servers to generate content dynamically. A reverse proxy and load balancer sit in front of one or more web servers and one or more web application servers to route traffic to the appropriate server, first based on the type of content requested and then based on the configured load-balancing algorithm. Most load balancer programs are also reverse proxy servers, which simplifies web application server architecture.
